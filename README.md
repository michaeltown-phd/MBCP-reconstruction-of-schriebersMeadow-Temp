# MBCP-reconstruction-of-schriebersMeadow-Temp
This is an initial project to reconstruct temperatures at Schrieber's Meadow, Mt. Baker, WA USA using meteorological data from the Mt. Baker Ski Resort.

The temperature reconstruction extends a temperature record for Schrieber's Meadow, Mt. Baker, WA USA. The target data set go from from July 2018 - July 2021. They were collected as part of the Mt. Baker Climate Project, in collaboration with the Lakeside School Outdoor Program. 

The feature data are collected in the Mt. Baker Ski Area on the north side of Mt. Baker, WA, USA. The data are described in the accompanying documents.

There are four scripts here to take note of:
1. A webscraping script that downloads the appropriate data from the Mt. Baker Ski Area/Resort. These data are served up by the Northwest Avalanche Center. (nwacWebScraping.py)
2. An initial EDA script that explores the NWAC data. (nwacEDA_HM_PD.py)
3. An initial EDA script that explores the MBCP data. (mbcpEDA.py)
4. A script that performs exploratory regression analysis. (regressionOfMBCP-NWAC.py)

There are several other files to note:
1. A summary document that briefly explains the analysis here. 
2. A presentation pdf.
3. An appendix of the results from the ordinary least squares analysis (appendix1-MBCPtemperatureReconstruction-michael-town.txt)

These results are preliminary. Please contact me with any questions.

Sincerely,
Mike (michaelstown@protonmail.com)
